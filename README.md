# Healthcare-Readmission-Analysis
This project demonstrates a sophisticated BI analysis that goes beyond internal data to generate deeper insights. It simulates a scenario where a healthcare provider wants to understand the external factors affecting patient readmission rates. The project involves an ETL pipeline that integrates an internal patient data export with an external CSV.
